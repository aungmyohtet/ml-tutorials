Mathematical proof of backpropagation algorithm is not fully understood yet.
Need more other articles to understand it.

I am close to fully understand backpropagation algorithm.
pdf in in my books-to-read folder in onedrive
close to understand raw python implementation of feed-forward network (https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning)

Read the following link(s)
http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap3.html#the_cross-entropy_cost_function
Nots from this link
  Properties of cost function
    1. Must be positive
    2. Approach to zero when target output is close to actual output
  Some problems of quadratic cost function
    Learning can be slow when the error is big
  How to solve
    Use cross-entropy function

  The cross-entropy is nearly always the better choice

  Softmax layer and softmax function
